\section{Introduction}

In this report I Am going to be informing you about a fourth generation game platform and explain its development and contribution into its historic context. The game console I Have chosen is the Super Nintendo Entertainment System also known as the SNES, personally this console means a lot to me as it's the console I Was brought up on as a child. I Will first give a brief introduction to what the SNES is and then go over the hardware and then move onto the impact it had on its generation.
\section{Main Body}

So what is the Super Nintendo Entertainment System? Released in Japan in 1990 the SNES is a 16 bit games console developed by Nintendo, being a global success the SNES was the best selling 16 bit games console and was still hugely popular through the 32 bit era. The 
SNES had the ability to allow tilling and simulated 3D effect with a pallet of 32, 768 colors as well as a high quality 8 channel audio all because of its state of the art graphics and sound co processors.

Before I Talk about my findings and research I Would like to give my own opinion on how significant the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was. When I Was little and we first got this console me and my Mum would play Super Mario World most nights, there was no net play or online if you wanted to play with someone they’d have to sit next to you but this was amazing and a new experience to the majority. This newly addicting box had tens of millions of people playing, children and adults alike and that’s how significant it was that people were taking time out of their day to sit down and play it. It might sound a bit extreme but the 16 bit era has significantly affected the generations, before children would be reading, out playing, spending time with family but now there's a new toy which with a lot of dispute does de socialise you from friends and family. People could see that games console were only going to get better, and this gave people a lot of inspiration and goals to be game developers and so on.

The so called greatest console war of all time was between the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. This alone had a huge impact on society, from advertising campaigns to people in day to day living taking sides on which one was the superior competitor. Firstly let's talk about which had the better hardware, although the SNES had the majority of its hardware upgraded which made it better than the Genesis it did not stop the Genesis from having additional features that allowed for it to keep up with the SNES such as its 1MB internal ROM and synthesizer. The SNES had an impressive 32,768 color pallet whereas the Genesis only had a mere 512, to be able to see such color difference in games would of adored the graphical improvement of the SNES. Both the SNES and the Genesis were sold at around £150, the SNES sold a whopping 49 million units with the Genesis just behind at 40 million units. That is an insane number of consoles to be sold in a decade, with this alone you are able to see the demand of game consoles to the public showing that game consoles were becoming something amazing and changing the way people live their lives. Just over 780 SNES games were released, 780 games that could affect people differently from giving them new ideas, making them see things differently or just giving them enjoyment out of playing them. The genesis had over 900 releases, again we need to think about the impact these games were having on people during the time. 
A main point i’d like to put across is desensitization, this is a big impact on society that has happened over the decades of the people getting less and less affected by violence, profanity and nudity. Although Television is a huge factor in this too, games are mainly seen as a under 18 year olds activity to do and from a young age they are influenced by these games. Sonic is a good example of a child's game that has a lot of violence in it, but with its childish colors and themes it seems fun and enjoyable. The main reason the Genesis had such a good fight in the console war was because of their game list, many prefered the Genesis games to the SNES because the SNES seemed to attract younger audience with games such as Mario. As with more recent consoles there have been many debates in school over which one is the better console, now I Don't know if there was fights back then but with personal experience I Have witnessed many heated discussions over which is the better one. And all though this is petty it shows that people are generally dedicated to one console and means that this is part of their life they are willing to fight for.


\section{Conclusion}

At the start of the report Stated that I Was going to be informing you about a fourth generation game platform and explain its development and contribution into its historic context. I Feel like I Was able to do this and also explain how the console war between SNES and Genesis also played a big part in that Decade of games consoles. in summary I Feel like the SNES did have a big impact on society through the sheer number of units sold and the amount of games that influenced many, although there was no direct research that I Found that said this from general research and logical thinking I Can say that it did and games will always affect people who play it.
Bibliography summary
The majority of my research came from online sources but I found them to be trustworthy sources. This is because the information they say can also be found out on other other sources.
